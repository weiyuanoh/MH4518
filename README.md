# Simulation and Analysis of a CHF Autocallable Barrier Reverse Convertible Product
## Introduction
This group project is part of the MH4518 Simulation Techniques in Finance module at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Our focus was to employ Monte Carlo simulation techniques to estimate the risk-neutral price of a financial derivative tied to two correlated underlying assets over a three-month period, specifically involving shares of Lonza Group AG (LONN.SE) and Sika AG (SIKA.SE).
